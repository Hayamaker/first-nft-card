This was my first serious HTML/CSS challenge! Honestly, loved it. It was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed feeling like I was actually working on a project that I could learn a lot from and could share it around with people. Please check out the 'NFT Card By Hayamaker' file inside the folder above this README in order to see all the code for the project!
