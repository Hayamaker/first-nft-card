## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

```html
<div>
  <img class="avatar" src="#" alt="Hayamaker">
  <p class="creator">Creation of <strong class="name">Hayamaker</strong></p>
</div>
```
This is my favorite HTML line in the project. It contains a pfp that I chose from one of my favorite anime and my username. I did it for the sake of adding something to make it seem original for me haha. 

```css
.view-div {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            opacity: 0;
            display: block;
            background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
            width: 230px;
            height: 230px;
            margin: 23px;
            border-radius: 6px;
            transform: translate(0%, 0%);
            -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
            z-index: 5;
        }
```

I learned a lot about translating the position of a div. I also managed to get the bare hang of paddings and margins, so I still gotta practice and get myself to understand more of them. I never thought that CSS would be this challenging when trying to get a div or literally anything in its perfect position, I spent a ton of time trying to do that, and It was worth it in the end.

### Continued development

I plan on learning JavaScript and messing around with it a bit before taking on another challenging project such as this. It was a lot of fun making the NFT Card, I personally enjoyed the process, and I hope to make more projects similar to this maybe even websites! After JavaScript, I might as well make a few projects with that and then consider creating small games, or small and simple websites such as the Pomodoro Technique, Tic-Tac-Toe, etc. That was it from me now!

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I used this website to look out for HTML/CSS concepts that I didn't understand and this really helped me a lot! This was my only resource to create the NFT Card because of how good it was for me.
